 They was a slight mix up on the order but they took care us while we were waiting. Everyone was so friendly we will be going back for sure.

 I love the building, very unique. Service was good although can tell they are short handed. Food was good too. I would return.

 Pizza, good stuff. Would eat here again. Definitely try the root beer on tap.  Stromboli is very good.  I really like the aesthetics of the place, really cool vibe.  Bathrooms are clean and there is a changing table in a spot where moms or dads can access it and that really speaks to me.

 Tia was our server and was so kind and helpful. The pizza is awesome!! Also, the grinder sandwich is massive and delicious. 100% will be coming back for the food, vibes, and service.

 Server was great! Pizza was even better. Always a great time. We live 3 hours away and we are planning a trip just for Sandy's pizza.

 Sandy's has been a little on the pricy side for a long time but I've tolerated it because of the sweet red peppers they have, which is the best part of their pizza. However, it's starting to get to be a little too pricy. Including an hour drive each way back towards where I grew up just to get to the restaurant, granted I only stop by when I have other reasons to go back to that area, two large pizzas and an order of bread sticks was nearly $60. I love the pizza, but it's getting too expensive to order from them even if I lived around there still.

 I give the great staff & great pizza five stars!!! They work so hard & they cook lovely food. We got to meet the owner while visiting to pay. However he's unwelcoming & rude. Greeted myself with my husband at the counter. He's fixing a prepaid phone (in the kitchen) with the sim card for gps tracking his delivery drivers. All while phone's ringing & the owner refused to answer phones when other customers had to be put on hold. We pay, wait in our vehicle, notice I'm missing an order & I messed my pie order up while ordering on the phone.  I go back, by myself, in to explain my order. Their cashier was helping me order a new pie & trying to get my misplaced sweet peppers we ordered from a previous order. (My mistake on not communicating correctly in my first order.) The owner tells the cashier to "answer the phones & ignore her". When the same cashier was in the middle of fixing the missing peppers from my first order & ringing up the second order. All I wish for is the workers getting higher salaries & better respect. The owner & his Tesla can be rude outside of his own restaurant. If he's inside leave & don't get disrespected.

 There's so many "meh" quality pizza places around that it can be difficult to weed out the good from the bad. If you're looking for great pizza look no further than "Sandy's Pizza", they've got the best pizza in the tri-state!I get sick of all those "bargain" pizzas from the big chain restaurants, that really aren't that good, but you settle for because of their internet specials. With Sandy's you get an excellent pizza cooked to perfection, loaded with delicious toppings. The sweet red peppers are a personal favorite! Staff is nice and friendly too!

 Great pizza. First time eating pizza here in 3 years. They need some help in kitchen. 25 min wait ontop of the 50 min wait they said it would be. Went to get pizza and the place only had 3 groups of people in the restaurant eating. Other than that, great experience.

Dale Johnson
 It was great, good service and fast an I drove from Evansville to fort branch to get it and it is so good I will drive it one's or twist a month to buy food from there it's that good.

 Recent visit didn't go too good but pizza was good in the past. Hopefully this was a one off. The marinara dipping sauce and pizza sauce literally tasted and smelled like beer. Very friendly and helpful waitress though.

 Sandys was very busy the night we got pizza, so it took longer than usual, but always worth the wait. The pizza with Stromboli meat,pepperoni and sweet red peppers was great and the chicken cranberry salad was fantastic!!

 Best pizza, our favorite place.  Antiques in restaurant and has been a small business forever.Please go and support their reopening. Oh, and they have buffet days too!!

 I had the ham and cheese sandwich, it was delicious! A very unique restaurant, one of a kind! Train runs the track directly behind the restaurant, feel it rumble hear it blow!

 To all my trucking friends. This place delivered to us at the Loves truckstop and they didn't disappoint! Although they forgot my garlic dipping sauce they were very prompt about bringing it to me. For our trouble they brought us 2 bottles of their root beer which is so delicious!  Please support this place and you will not be disappointed. The pizza and wings we order was so good!

Wyatt Arvin
 Great local pizza restaurant. The restaurant itself is decorated with nostalgic Americana themes. We came here for the Sunday buffet. Due to the smaller size of the restaurant, the selection of pizza was limited. What it lacked in variety, it made up for in quality and taste. Included in the adult buffet is even one beer or wine. They had dessert pizza (Apple) and soft serve ice cream. Definitely recommend.

Leigh Childers
 Went for the buffet tonight. There was limited pizza available when we got there but after we sat down, a waitress asked how the buffet looked and if she could make us anything which I thought was great. I love the buffet here. It's a great price that includes, the pizza bar, pasta bar, salad bar, ice cream and drink.

 Pizza is very good! Love the sweet red peppers! The combination is what we got it had a few too many olives for me. But my husband really likes them. The cheesey bread is very good we didnt get it before our meal which was kind of disappointing.  But it was delicious.  We was here on a Sunday evening and they had 2 large parties in the back and they could have used another waitress. But overall it was a good place to eat.

 If you like red bell peppers be sure to get them on your pizza! They are sweet and add a unique flavor to whatever pizza you get. Nostalgic environment.

 Great atmosphere and even greater pizza. I ordered the all meat with the "sweet reds" (red peppers) and it was delicious. The crust was thin and crispy and the pizza was baked to perfection. Being from out of town and eating our local pizza, this is definitely a nice change from our usual pizza. Sandy's is a place you should give a try, because you'll come back often. Oh, and our server was excellent too. Her recommendations for the pizzas we ordered made a huge difference.

 Unique interior...there's vintage things all over the walls and ceiling. Kids of all ages love the ice cream machine...self-served. Salad bar is great. Daily lunch buffet. Dinner buffet Tues and Wed nights. Id say most people develope a craving for their sweet red peppers. Barbecue Chicken pizza without the jalape�os is my favorite. Give this place a try.

 Pizza is awesome. The fact that they don't keep fresh pizzas coming out on the buffet  makes it not worth the drive for us. I understand food cost but gas is expensive and time is priceless. I heard about there pizza a lot. Finally had it for lunch 4 days in two weeks. The Root beer is sooo good tho
